# LetsMake Product Workflow — cheat sheet

One-page reference for BA/PO work before engineering owns `spec.md`. Program-agnostic — use across any product or program.

**Full doc:** [letsmake-product-workflow.md](./letsmake-product-workflow.md) · **Skills:** `skills/README.md` in the pack

## Flow (one line)

**Intake → Discover → Grill + parallel research → Gap pass → Consolidated requirements → Dev handoff → spec + build**

## Support loops

These can happen anytime; they support the PO-led workflow and do not make product decisions automatically.

| Loop               | Use it for                                                      | Output                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Context inbox      | Raw notes, PO ideas, videos, Figma comments, stakeholder inputs | CI-_ row → decision / OQ / R-_ / EAR-\* / archive |
| Agent context map  | Keep future chats focused                                       | phase + read-first docs + authority order         |
| Artifact eval      | Check quality before moving phases                              | pass / needs PO / needs cleanup                   |
| Prototype / signal | Risky UX or hard-to-explain behavior                            | P-\* row → signal → AskQuestion decision          |
| Memory / recall    | Anything already decided/researched (see memory-system.md)      | citations (PDR / RULE / R ids) — or new R-\*      |

| 0   | Intake           | `discovery.md`                            |
| 1   | Discover         | `discovery.md`                            |
| 2   | Grill + research | `discovery.md` + canvases                 |
| 3   | Gap pass         | `gap-analysis.md` → **`requirements.md`** |
| 4   | Dev handoff      | DoR package                               |
| 5+  | Engineering      | `spec.md`                                 |

## Artifacts

```text
discovery.md              Living — brief, grill, research
discovery.md § Context inbox   Raw input queue
discovery.md § Agent context map   Read-first routing
discovery.md § Artifact eval log   Quality checks
gap-analysis.md           Audit (not in requirements)
requirements.md           SSOT after gap pass
{feature}/research/sources/   YouTube transcripts
docs/research/canvas-index.md   Canvas bookmark
```

**SSOT wins:** `requirements.md` > discovery, handoff, PRDs

## Locked rules

- **AskQuestion** for PO decisions (TBC + owner OK)
- **Auto-launch research** on gaps/ideas (parallel default); **PO adopts proposals** — research never edits `requirements.md`
- **No `[FIGMA Δ]`** in requirements — audit in gap-analysis
- **Must stories:** observable Gherkin + AC summary + DoD
- **EAR-\*** for epic-adjacent research — PO dispositions, no silent scope
- **No auto-generated requirements** skipping gap pass on grill/design-led features
- Raw inputs go through **Context inbox** before requirements
- Eval can clean formatting, but **needs PO** goes to AskQuestion

Full shared rules: [`letsmake-conventions.md`](./letsmake-conventions.md).

**Optional Linear sync:** `gap-pass`/`increment-requirements` can mirror new OQs to Linear one-way (docs → Linear) if configured + PO opt-in — see `letsmake-conventions.md` § Linear sync.

## Research types

`desk` · `comparable` · `figma` · `video` (YouTube/Loom → `scripts/youtube-transcript.sh`) · `technical` · `prototype`

**Canvas quality:** follow [`canvas-authoring.md`](./canvas-authoring.md) — wrong Table/CardHeader API → empty blocks.

## Definition of Ready (summary)

Canonical gate: [letsmake-product-workflow.md](./letsmake-product-workflow.md) § Dev handoff gate — the `dev-handoff` skill verifies it.

- Must stories verifiable; goals measurable
- No Must **TBC** without owner + path
- Behavior not deferred to spec only
- Context inbox / prototype signal has no untriaged blocker
- Artifact eval log has no unresolved `needs PO`
